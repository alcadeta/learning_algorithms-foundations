    /// the list and compares it to the number that's being search, determining
    /// whether they're equal (item is found), lesser than the number that's
    /// being searched (set the lower index to the middle), or greater than the
    /// number being searched (set the upper index to the middle. It repeats
    /// this process until either the number is found or the indexes cross each
    /// other, indicating that the number is not found.
